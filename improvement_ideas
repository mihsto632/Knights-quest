IMPROVEMENT IDEAS:
Add a file in the format (ex):
Player:      Score:
1.Player_1     300
2.Player_2     280
...
10.Player_10   120

Every time there's a new player who finished the game, read the entire file (all 10 players from the scoreboard) into 10 objects (of a class that will contain player name and score),
and compare the new player score to every other on the existing scoreboard list, in order to place it. 
If the new player's score has a place in top 10, insert the new name and the score and rearange all others in a vector that contains 10 objects. 
Then write the content of the vector into the file.
